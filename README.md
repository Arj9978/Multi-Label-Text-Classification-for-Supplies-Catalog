# Multi-Label-Text-Classification-for-Supplies-Catalog
Welcome to the Multi-Label Text Classification for Supplies Catalog repository! ðŸ“šâœ¨  In this project, we explore the exciting realm of natural language processing (NLP) by tackling the complex task of multi-label text classification in the context of a supplies catalog.

## Project Goals

ðŸŽ¯ **1. Multi-Label Classification:** Our main goal is to build and fine-tune machine learning models capable of accurately predicting multiple labels or categories associated with a given product description.

ðŸ“Š **2. Dataset Preparation:** We provide insights and code on how to collect, clean, and preprocess textual data from a supplies catalog, making it ready for training robust models.

ðŸ§  **3. Model Selection and Training:** We delve into various state-of-the-art NLP models suitable for multi-label classification. This includes pre-trained models like BERT, RoBERTa, and more. We guide you through the training process, ensuring you grasp the essentials of adapting these models for your specific task.

ðŸ“ˆ **4. Performance Metrics:** Understanding model performance is crucial. We cover metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and explain how to interpret them in the context of multi-label classification.

ðŸš€ **5. Deployment Strategies:** Once your model is trained, we discuss deployment options, from creating APIs to integrating the model into a web interface for easy catalog searches.

ðŸ“š **6. Learning Resources:** Whether you're an NLP novice or a seasoned practitioner, our repository provides a collection of resources, papers, and tutorials to enhance your understanding of multi-label text classification and its applications.
